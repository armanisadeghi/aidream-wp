Explanation:
Class and Method: The AI_Dream_WP_Activator class has a static method named activate, which will be called during the plugin's activation.
Activation Tasks: Inside the activate method, you can add the code that needs to run when the plugin is activated. This could include setting up plugin options, creating custom database tables, or other initialization tasks.
Options Setup: The example provided checks if a specific option exists and, if not, adds it. This is a common pattern for setting default configurations for your plugin.
Integration:
To call this activation method, you would typically hook it into the WordPress activation process within your main plugin file (aidream-wp.php). Here's how you might do that:

php
Copy code
register_activation_hook(__FILE__, array('AI_Dream_WP_Activator', 'activate'));
Customization:
Customize the activation tasks according to the specific requirements of your plugin. This might include more complex database operations, initial setup procedures, or migration tasks for updates in the future.
